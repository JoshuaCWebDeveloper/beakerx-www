### How is BeakerX related to Beaker Notebook?

BeakerX is the successor to Beaker Notebook.  After seeing the demo of
[Jupyter Lab at SciPy
2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejh0ftSjk6g) we realized that
Jupyter had become extensible enough that much of what made Beaker
special could be done in the Jupyter ecosystem.

The result of joining forces with Jupyter is a more powerful tool for
our users, and a larger community of developers and users that
continues to grow.  Jupyter users benefit by getting access to our
work as well.  And we benefit by leveraging shared infrastructure so
we can focus on adding value.

It has taken about a year to port Beaker's key features to become
extensions to Jupyter, and we are very exited to finish this
transition and release the results with a new name "BeakerX" that
represents both our history and how large a change this is.

### Can I install BeakerX with pip instead of conda?

Yes, see the [instructions](/documentation#pip).  Our documentation
focuses on conda for simplicity.
