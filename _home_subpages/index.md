## Interactive Plotting

![image title](/static/img/time-series.png)

All of BeakerX's JVM languages plus Python and JavaScript have APIs
for interactive time-series, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and
treemaps.  The widgets remain interactive in both notebooks saved to
disk, and notebooks published to the web.  They include unique
features for handling many points, nanosecond resolution, zooming, and
exporting.

## Interactive Tables

BeakerX's table widget automatically recognizes pandas dataframes and allows
you to search, sort, drag, filter, format, select, graph, hide, pin,
and export to CSV or clipboard.  This makes connecting to
spreadsheets quick and easy.

With a single click, convert the current notebook's contents including
any interactive widgets to a Github gist. A new tab opens nbviewer on
it, including the active widgets.  This is a link you can send anyone.
