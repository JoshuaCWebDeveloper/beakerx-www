All of BeakerX's JVM languages plus Python and JavaScript have APIs
for [interactive
time-series](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/anonymous/7450f2ef784f72f5811ee54ed3d97fdb),
scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and treemaps.  The widgets remain
interactive in both notebooks saved to disk, and notebooks published
to the web.  They include unique features for handling many points,
nanosecond resolution, zooming, and exporting.

## Interactive Tables

BeakerX's [table
widget](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/anonymous/d7dbf536abade987157c085b1850416d)
automatically recognizes pandas dataframes and allows you to search,
sort, drag, filter, format, select, graph, hide, pin, and export to
CSV or clipboard.  This makes connecting to spreadsheets quick and
easy.

## Publication

With a single click, convert the current notebook's contents including
any interactive widgets to a Github gist. A new tab opens nbviewer on
it, including the active widgets.  This is a link you can send anyone.
