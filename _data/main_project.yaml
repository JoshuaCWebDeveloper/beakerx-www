text: > #
  BeakerX is a collection of kernels and extensions to the
  [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} interactive computing environment. It provides JVM support,
  interactive plots, tables, forms, publishing, and more.  BeakerX supports:

    - Groovy, Scala, Clojure, Kotlin, Java, and SQL, including many magics;
    - Widgets for time-series plotting, tables, forms, and more (there are Python and JavaScript APIs
      in addition to the JVM languages);
    - One-click publication with interactive plots and tables, and
    - Jupyter Lab (alpha quality).

  A beta release of BeakerX is available via conda, pip, and
  docker. Or build and run the latest code from
  [github](https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx){:target="_blank"}.

      Docker is a great way to run and manage servers including
      Jupyter with BeakerX built-in.  BeakerX has a
      [container](https://hub.docker.com/r/beakerx/beakerx/){:target="_blank"}
      distributed by Docker Hub so you can download and run it with
      just one command: `docker run -p 8888:8888 beakerx/beakerx`
