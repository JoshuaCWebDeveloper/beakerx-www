      Docker is a great way to run and manage servers including
      Jupyter with BeakerX built-in.  BeakerX has a
      [container](https://hub.docker.com/r/beakerx/beakerx/)
      distributed by Docker Hub so you can download and run it with
      just one command: `docker run -p 8888:8888 beakerx/beakerx`
