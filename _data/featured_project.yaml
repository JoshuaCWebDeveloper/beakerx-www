title: Flint
text: > #
    Flint is a time series analytics library 
    for Apache Spark, designed to extend the
    Spark library to manipulate and analyze 
    time series data at massive scale. It 
    leverages the speed and reliability of 
    Spark, but provides a time series-aware 
    data structure that extends RDD.
